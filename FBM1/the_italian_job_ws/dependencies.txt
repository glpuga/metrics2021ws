The software stack used here is based on OpenVSLAM and general ROS packages (robot-localization, cv_bridge).

In order to buildl OpenVSLAM a number of libraries need to be installed/updated in the base system. The
full intallation instructions used to do this can be found here:

https://openvslam-community.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

The exact sequence, with comments, can be found in the docker build file that's included in this image within
the /home/metrics/the_italian_job_docker folder.

Additionally, the rpg_trajectory_evaluation has been installed from source from the original
repository to evaluate the solution during development. This was done simply by cloning the repository
into the catkin workspace.
